2019/07/29 (version 1.10.1)

  Fix bug in composite spatial database. Allow queries that only use
  one of the two spatial databases.

2019/07/01 (version 1.10.0)

  Added UserFunctionDB for user-specified analytical functions.

  Changed GravityField::gravAcceleration() to GravityField::gravityAcc
  for consistency with gravityDir().

  Add methods for computing density scale and pressure scale from
  other scales. Only three of length scale, time scale, pressure
  scale, and density scale are independent.

2017/07/07 (version 1.9.10)

  Improved error messages when reading SimpleDB and SimpleGridDB files.
  Provide information about the number of points read and instructions on
  how to fix common problems.

2017/06/19 (version 1.9.9)

  BUGFIX: Improved Python interface to SimpleGridDB to make it
  possible to write 1-D and 2-D files.

  Improve validation error messages; some error messages were missing
  spatial database label.

2017/03/24 (version 1.9.8)

  Added temperature scale to Nondimensional.

  Changed query values for gravity field (GravityField) from x, y, z to
  gravity_field_x, gravity_field_y, gravity_field_z. This makes it easier
  to use gravity within applications with other fields.

2016/10/13 (version 1.9.7)

  Add version information.

  Fix compilation issues associated with gcc-6.x.

  Added configuration for testing via Travis.

2016/06/14 (version 1.9.6)

  Improve checking for parsing errors for spatial database files.

2015/02/13 (version 1.9.5)

  Added check for no data when validating UniformDB.

2014/08/19 (version 1.9.4)

  Updates to files for compatibility with automake v1.14.1. Also
  changed libsrc layout to eliminate need to export header files.

2013/09/17 (version 1.9.3)

  Removed use of Python eggs in configuration and install.

2013/06/13 (version 1.9.2)

  Set spatialdata label in template test to avoid error message about
  unset parameter.

2012/12/10 (version 1.9.1)

  Fixed some small memory leaks (mostly in unit tests).  Updated
  cit_python.m4 macros to fix configure errors on some systems.

2012/10/22 (version 1.9.0)

  Added local origin and rotation angle to projected geographic
  coordinate system. This provides a local origin to geographic
  projects that do not necessarily support them in addition to rotated
  coordinate systems.

  Added SimpleGridDB for efficient querying of data on logical
  grids. Works in 1-D, 2-D, and 3-D for lower-dimension grids, e.g.,
  1-D in 3-D space.

2012/03/23 (version 1.8.2)

  Added ability to use empty ellipsoid and datum in order to use +init option
  for Google Earth projections.

2012/01/27 (version 1.8.1)

  Fixed parsing of non-derived units (e.g., degree and radian) in for
  UniformDB spatial databases.


2011/11/09 (version 1.8.0)

  Changed to old syntax for catching exceptions for compatibility with Python 2.4.

  Added single precision wrapper for SpatialDB query.


2011/07/07 (version 1.7.1)

  Require labels for spatial databases.

  Check for empty filenames.

  Improve error messages.


2011/05/06 (version 0.7.0)

  Added check for more than one point in SimpleDB with zero data
  dimension.

  Permit whitespace in values and data for UniformDB.


2010/06/08 (version 0.6.0)

  Permit nondimensionl values in spatial databases.


2009/07/06 (version 0.5.2)

  Added --enable-swig configure argument because source distribution
  already contains the SWIG generated files (use --enable-swig when
  using the source repository).

2009/07/01 (version 0.5.1)

  Fixed trapping of errors from Python when using units parser.

2009/06/19 (version 0.5.0)

  Switched to SWIG for Python modules. Added parsing of units in
  SimpleDB headers. Added time history files.

2007/02/26

  Switched to using numpy arrays as arguments in Python
  SimpleIOAscii::write(). This greatly simplifies creating a database
  from Python. Simplified GenSimpleDBApp so that it is all Python.

2007/01/01

  Changed interface so that it no longer uses pointers to pointers
  when passing arrays as arugments. You now pass just a pointer to
  where the values are to be stored. This makes the user interface
  cleaner.

  Numpy version >= 1.0 is now required (previous changeset).

2007/01/07

  Changed interfaces to allow spatial dimension of coordinate systems
  to be 1-D and 2-D instead of just 3-D.
